        benchmark_case_id:
            Database identifier of the benchmark case being executed.

        status:
            Execution-level state.

            'completed' means inference returned normally.

            'failed' means inference could not complete and diagnostic information was captured instead.

            This status does not yet indicate whether the model's answer was  correct.
            Quality scoring is a separate benchmark stage.

        started_at:
            UTC timestamp immediately before inference execution begins.

        completed_at:
            UTC timestamp recorded when execution finishes or fails.

        inference_result:
            Normalized mondel output and telemetry when inference succeeds.

            Failed executions leave this as 'None'.

        error_type:
            Exception class name when execution fails.

        error_message:
            Human_readable exception messafe retained for diagnostics.
