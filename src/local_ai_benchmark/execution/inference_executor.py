"""
Inference execution contract used by benchmark infrastructure.

The benchmark runner must not depend directly on OllamaClient or any other specific inference backend.

Any inference adapter that implements the required 'chat' method can satisfy
this protocol through Python's structural typing.

    The protocol deliberately describes behavior rather than a concrete class.

    OllamaClient already satisfies this contract because it exposes:

    Future inference backends can satisfy the same protocol without inheriting
    from OllamaClient or changing benchmark-runner code.
